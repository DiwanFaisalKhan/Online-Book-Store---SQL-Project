# Online-Book-Store---SQL-Project

Project Overview

This project is a SQL-based analysis of an Online Book Store, designed to demonstrate data management, query writing, and analysis skills using a relational database. I have implemented this project using PostgreSQL, but the SQL scripts can be executed on any other relational database system (MySQL, SQL Server, etc.) with minor adjustments.


Project Files

Books.csv: Contains details of the books available in the store (BookID, Title, Author, Genre, Price).

Customers.csv: Contains customer information (CustomerID, CustomerName, Email, Phone).

Orders.csv: Contains order records (OrderID, CustomerID, BookID, Quantity, OrderDate).



Database_and_Table_Creation_Script.sql: 

PostgreSQL script to create the database and tables for this project.

SQL_Questions_Online_Book_Store.sql: A set of SQL questions designed for data analysis.

ALL_SQL_Query_Solution.sql: Complete solutions for all the SQL questions.



Key Features

Database Creation: Structured with clear relationships among the three tables.

SQL Queries (PostgreSQL): Covering basic to advanced concepts including joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and date functions.

Real-World Use Case: Simulates a functional online book store, making the analysis practical.



How to Use
