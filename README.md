# Online Book Store — SQL Project

## Project Overview

This project is based on an **Online Book Store** and is built using **SQL and PostgreSQL**. The aim is to demonstrate database design, data handling, and SQL query skills using a real-world scenario.

Although the project uses PostgreSQL, all SQL scripts can be easily adapted for other relational databases like **MySQL** or **SQL Server** with minor changes.

## Project Files

- **Books.csv** — Contains information about the books  
  *(BookID, Title, Author, Genre, Price)*

- **Customers.csv** — Contains details of the customers  
  *(CustomerID, CustomerName, Email, Phone)*

- **Orders.csv** — Contains order data  
  *(OrderID, CustomerID, BookID, Quantity, OrderDate)*

- **Database_and_Table_Creation_Script.sql** —  
  SQL script to create the database and required tables

- **SQL_Questions_Online_Book_Store.sql** —  
  A list of SQL questions based on the dataset for practice

- **ALL_SQL_Query_Solution.sql** —  
  Complete solutions to the above SQL questions

## Key Features

- **Relational Database Design** — Well-structured schema with relationships between `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders`
- **SQL Queries** — Includes basic to advanced queries like:
  - JOINs
  - Aggregations
  - Subqueries
  - Date functions
- **Practical Use Case** — Mimics a real online bookstore scenario for better understanding

## How to Use

1. Run the `Database_and_Table_Creation_Script.sql` file to set up the database and tables.
2. Import the CSV files into their respective tables (`Books`, `Customers`, `Orders`).
3. Use `SQL_Questions_Online_Book_Store.sql` to try different data analysis queries.
4. Check `ALL_SQL_Query_Solution.sql` for the solutions.
